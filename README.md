This tool was generated as a one-off to help crack someone's ETH wallet password. If you want to use this for free- go for it! Don't even bother letting me know. Unfortunately though, it's pretty undocumented. So, if you want, you could email me at phildo211 via g mail, and I could try cracking it for you!

if you end up using this and successfully unlocking your wallet, please consider donating!
